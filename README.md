##Â Zeppelin COntexte project

### This is the notebook

## How to

1) [Install Zeppelin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin) with the latest Spark version. (If it doesn't work with the last one, try with the 1.3).

2) You will need the content of [that pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/60) (#60) in order to get the %jdbc  interpreter to work.

Then, the JDBC interpreter should show up in your "Interpreter" tab while running zeppelin ( go in zeppelin and run /bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start )

## Chunks of code

They are organized by order. Simply copy/paste them into a new notbook in zeppelin.

They are separated by "--" After each "--", this is a new note.
